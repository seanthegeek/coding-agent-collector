# Changelog

All notable changes to the analyzer are recorded here. The version is
printed by `--version`. Changes to the `timeline.csv` and `sessions.csv`
columns are called out, since they are interfaces.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- The `timeline` summary no longer lists `project` among the agents that
  were detected but not parsed.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- Transcript parsers for Gemini CLI, Qwen Code, Kiro (Amazon Q Developer CLI
  conversations), Crush, Goose, Zed, VS Code chat sessions, Continue, Aider,
  OpenCode, Kilo Code, Cline and Roo Code, for sixteen parsed agents in all.
- Dependency on the `zstandard` package for Zed threads; without it each Zed
  thread becomes one undecodable `system` row and everything else runs.

### Changed

- Files the collector found inside a discovered repository (agent `project`
  in the manifest) are offered to every parser, so a repository's
  `.crush/crush.db` and `.aider.*` files are parsed and their rows carry the
  real agent. `--agent` filters on that agent, so `--agent aider` includes
  repository-level Aider files.
- `detect` no longer reports `project` as a parsed agent.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- Antigravity CLI parser for its SQLite conversation databases, decoded from
  the protobuf schemas embedded in the shipped binary. SQLite stores are read
  from a copy taken with their WAL and SHM sidecars, so the evidence copy is
  never opened and uncheckpointed rows are kept.
- Detection of the catalog entries added in collectors 1.2.0 and 1.3.0.

### Changed

- `timeline.csv`: the `summary` column is renamed `text`, in the same
  position, and holds the event's full text by default.
- `--max-text-length N` replaces `--summary-length N` and defaults to `0`,
  no cut; the old default cut at 400 characters.
- In loose mode a nested catalog entry claims its subtree, as in the
  collectors, so Antigravity CLI files under `~/.gemini` are attributed to
  `antigravity`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- `detect`, `timeline` and `catalog` commands, reading a collector archive,
  an extracted collection, or a loose directory such as a mounted image, a
  copied home or a single agent directory.
- Detection of every agent in the collectors' catalog. Host, user and agent
  come from the manifest when present; for loose input they are inferred
  from paths and marked as inferred.
- Parsers for Claude Code (session transcripts, subagent transcripts,
  `history.jsonl`) and Codex CLI (rollouts, `history.jsonl`).
- `timeline.csv` columns: `timestamp_utc`, `host`, `user`, `agent`,
  `session_id`, `project_path`, `git_branch`, `turn_type`, `model`,
  `tool_name`, `tool_use_id`, `summary`, `source_file`, `source_line`.
- `sessions.csv` columns: `host`, `user`, `agent`, `session_id`,
  `project_path`, `first_timestamp_utc`, `last_timestamp_utc`, `models`,
  `user_turns`, `assistant_turns`, `tool_calls`, `source_file`.
- Options `--host`, `--user`, `--work-dir`, `--keep-extracted`,
  `--summary-length` (default 400), `--include-thinking` and `--agent`;
  `detect --json` and `--files`; `catalog --agents`.
